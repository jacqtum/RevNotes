COOL FACTS:

Did you know that browsers have a debugger for JavaScript.

The keyword shift removes the first element of the array and returns the element.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

<style> </style> defines inline-styles.

<br> for line break.

<a href="url"></a>

<img src="">

<input type = "text">

Linking is not a methodology used for linking css, but REFERENCING it.
