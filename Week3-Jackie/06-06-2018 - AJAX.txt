ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT AND JSON (BEcause not Using XML) (AJAX)

* https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp

* Ajax is not a programming language.

* HTTP request from your browser to your HTML DOM.

* Asynchronous means not existing or happening at the same time.

* We don't want each of our HTTP REQUESTS waiting for each other to complete.

* We can refresh certain elements without having to reload the page.
	- The element already exists, but it does not show unless an event or interactionoccurs.

* AJAX uses a combination of:
	- A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server).
	- JavaSCript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

Front End
	-Event: 
		- Ex: Clicking a button
		- Grabs information and prepare the object
		- Send HTTP Request.
			- Send it to whatever processes the response and update the page.

AJAX WorkFlow
1. CREATE / OPEN the XMLHttpRequest() -> XHR Object
2. DEFINE onreadystatechange Function
3. Open our request XHR.open(HTTP method, url, true/false)
	* Example HTTP method: GET
	* For asynchronous, use TRUE
4. Send Request (w/ Request body if needed)
	* xhr.send()
	* If it's a POST, send with request body.

Examples of Usage:
* Database transactions.
	- Want to occur after one event.
		- Entering amount of money will occur before sending information to the database.

PROS OF AJAX
* Update a web page without reloading the page.
* Request data from a server - after the page has loaded.
* Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded.
* Send data to a server - in the background
